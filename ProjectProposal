For players looking to experience a new twist in a tried and true game
formula and miss simplistic, explosive, and thrill inducing gameplay that
retro games offered. The product, called "King of the Bomb",
(Note: ask others for better names) takes inspiration from
the nostalgic Bomberman series allowing groups of four friends to compete in
an area, literally blowing away the competition (each other) in a last man
standing game mode. Perfect for having fun, killing time, and ease of play
anyone can become a master of the art of explosions! However, unlike other games
that simply emulate the formula of overhead gameplay in an enclosed space with a
short simple objective, our product puts a spin on the perspective of the gamer
to induce a more exciting and heart-pounding experience. Our product places the
player in a first person perspective with only one life, no minimap, and only
the sound of other player's explosives to find help them find targets. If
they've been eliminated, a player spawns as ghost capable of putting
"Shriek Bombs", fake explosives that living players can see to induce panic.
Ghost players are invisible and cannot affect the map but, their explosives and
effects appear real with a slight modification to their bombs appearance.
Blowing someone up is bound to create a vengeful wraith,
so why not get your revenge by scaring your friends?
