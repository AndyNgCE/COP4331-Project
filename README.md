# COP4331-Project
This is the repository for the COP4331 game!

Project Proposal:
For players looking to experience a new twist in a tried and true game
formula and miss simplistic, explosive, and thrill inducing gameplay that
retro games offered. Our game, "King of the Bomb",
takes inspiration from the nostalgic Bomberman series allowing groups of four
friends to compete in an area, literally blowing away the competition (each other)
in a last man standing game mode. Perfect for having fun, killing time, and with
ease of play that allows anyone to become a master of the art of explosions,
players are sure to enjoy themselves when competing against their friends! Unlike other games
that simply emulate the formula of overhead mini-battle arenas, our product puts
a spin on the perspective of the gamer to induce a more exciting and
heart-pounding experience. The player experiences everything in a first person perspective
with only one life, no minimap, and only the sound of other player's explosives to help them find
the competition. If they've been eliminated, a player spawns as ghost capable of putting
"Shriek Bombs", fake explosives that living players can see to induce panic.
Ghost players are invisible and cannot affect the map but, their explosives and
effects appear real with a slight modification to their appearances.
Blowing someone up is bound to create a vengeful wraith,
so why not get your revenge by scaring your friends? Eliminate everyone and become the
King of Bombs!
